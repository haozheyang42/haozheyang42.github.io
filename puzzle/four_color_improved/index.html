        <h3>Instructions: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mathematicians have proven that you can color any map in four colors. Now you are going to color a map with four colors (red, yellow, blue, and green) such that no two country that share a boarder will have the same color.</li>
            <li>You will be asked to try to use as few of one color as possible. Say red.</li>
            <li>There will be a color bar on the left. When you select one color, it is going to have a purple ring around it. You can color a block by selecting a color and then press the block.</li>
            <li>If you submit a incorret solution, there will be a 30 seconds penalty. After the penalty, the incorrect colors are going to be removed.</li>
            <li>After both player submitted their solution, whoever has the fewest number of the color that you try to minimize wins. Which means whoever uses fewer red wins in this example.</li>
            <li>If the number of the color are the same, then whoever uses less time wins. Which means if the player has same number of red, then whoever uses less time wins.</li>
            <li>If the number of the color and the time are the same, then it is going to be a tie game.</li>
        </ul>
