        <ul>
            <li>Choose a Level (2 to 6).</li>
            <li>The game board has blocks with numbers in it. Also there is a single "hole" that can be used for moving the blocks.</li>
            <li>The objective of the game is to order the numbers using the "hole" for temporary movement.</li>
            <li>Move blocks in a row by clicking on them. A block can be moved only if it is in the same row or column as the "hole".</li>
            <li>You can move multiple blocks (in the same row or column as the "hole") by clicking the farthest block that you need to be moved.</li>
