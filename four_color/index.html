    <h3>Instructions: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mathematicians have proven that you can color any map in four colors. Now you are going to color a map with four colors (red, yellow, blue, and green) such that no two country that share a boarder will have the same color.</li>
      <li>You will be asked to try to use as few of one color as possible. Say red.</li>
      <li>After you minimized that color, you will then try to minimize the number of occurance of another color. Say green.</li>
      <li>There will be a color bar on the left. When you select one color, it is going to have a purple ring around it. You can color a block by selecting a color and then press the block.</li>
      <li>If you submit a incorret solution, there will be a 30 seconds penalty. After the penalty, the incorrect colors are going to be removed.</li>
      <li>After both player submitted their solution, whoever has the fewest number of the first color that you try to minimize wins. Which means whoever uses fewer red wins in this example.</li>
      <li>If the number of the first color are the same, then whoever has the fewest number of the second color that you try to minimize wins. Which means if the player has same number of red, then whoever has the same number of green wins in this example.</li>
      <li>If the number of the first color and the second are the same, then whoever uses less time wins. Which means if the player has same number of red and green, then whoever uses less time wins.</li>
      <li>If the number of the first color and the second are the same, and the amount time spent are the same, then it is going to be a tie game.</li>
    </ul>
